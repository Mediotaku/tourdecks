A new application for people who love touring :airplane: :japanese_castle: :sunrise_over_mountains:

A personal project in Flutter to practice and have fun with animations. 

***Work in progress***

# Description

:flower_playing_cards: In TourDecks, tour guides can create visual tours in the form of image card decks. Each card provides information about an interest point in the tour, with a written description and location marker.

:calling: Guides can then cast their tours in real time to their clients' app, who will see anything the tour guide want to share with them at that point of the itirerary. 

:framed_picture: After the tour wraps up, clients will have the their own copy of the TourDeck in their app, for whenever they want to revisit the experience, or search for some info they missed at the time.

:book: **No account, no cloud**. A personal travel diary in your local storage, a collection of memories that will be gone if you let it go.
